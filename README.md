Day 1: Today, I solved the GeeksforGeeks problem of the day. Here is the link to the solution: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/xor-subarray-xors/. This problem is tricky; I needed to calculate the frequency and then compute the XOR value. Finally, I summed up the results in an XOR part. Additionally, I increased my ATS score from 30 to 54 (https://resumeworded.com).

Day 2: Today, I solved the GeeksforGeeks problem of the day. Here is the link to the solution: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/position-rightmost-different-bit/. This is an easy problem; I just needed to use a vector because there is no size defined for it.
