Day 1: Today, I solved the GeeksforGeeks problem of the day. Here is the link to the solution: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/xor-subarray-xors/. This problem is tricky; I needed to calculate the frequency and then compute the XOR value. Finally, I summed up the results in an XOR part. Additionally, I increased my ATS score from 30 to 54 (https://resumeworded.com).

Day 2: Today, I solved the GeeksforGeeks problem of the day. Here is the link to the solution: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/position-rightmost-different-bit/. This is an easy problem; I just needed to use a vector because there is no size defined for it.

Day 3: Today, I solved an interesting question from GeeksforGeeks. It was a simple one where we had to find the XOR of all the elements in the array and then just check whether the result is 0 or 1. According to the result, players won the match. Here is the answer and question with different approaches: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-winner-nim-game/.". Also i started to learn python as well for my research paper.
