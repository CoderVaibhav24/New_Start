# New_Start
 
Day 1: Today, I solved the GeeksforGeeks problem of the day. Here is the link to the solution: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/xor-subarray-xors/. This problem is tricky; I needed to calculate the frequency and then compute the XOR value. Finally, I summed up the results in an XOR part. Additionally, I increased my ATS score from 30 to 54 (https://resumeworded.com).

Day 2: Today, I solved the GeeksforGeeks problem of the day. Here is the link to the solution: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/position-rightmost-different-bit/. This is an easy problem; I just needed to use a vector because there is no size defined for it.

Day 3: Today, I solved an interesting question from GeeksforGeeks. It was a simple one where we had to find the XOR of all the elements in the array and then just check whether the result is 0 or 1. According to the result, players won the match. Here is the answer and question with different approaches: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-winner-nim-game/.". Also i started to learn python as well for my research paper.

Day 4: Today, I solved a hard level problem in which I have distrube candies between children in such a way that every child should get one mnin candy and then distrub the candy according to the rating of the child. Here is the solution for the problem https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-number-of-candies-required-to-distribute-among-children-based-on-given-conditions/.

Day 5: Today, I solved a medium level problem on the topic of Activity Selection which was easy here is the solution for the problem https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-maximum-meetings-in-one-room/. And today I finally started python and i am trying to build a rpm game for learning purpose.

Day 6: Today, I solved an easy level program where i have find the number of elements which occurs more than n/k in an array. In this I used hash map to calculate frequency of each element in O(N). Then i used a loop to counter the number.Here is the solution for this problem https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-an-array-of-of-size-n-finds-all-the-elements-that-appear-more-than-nk-times/. I also did my python a little.
